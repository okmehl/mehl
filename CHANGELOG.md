Changelog
=========

Upgrade should run fine as long as you generate a new stack
configuration and upgrade your mehl.env.

Please note that the current master is what we call a "soft release": It’s there for everyone to see and use, but to limit possible user-impact of this very big release, it’s not yet the default in the setup-utility for new users. When upgrading, please treat it with some care, and be sure to always have backups!
