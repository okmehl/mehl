<p>Mehl comes in multiple "flavors". It was originally
designed to run on top of Docker Swarm but will offer multiple options
including Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Please note that "official" support, that is provided by the most active
developers will mostly cover Docker Swarm, while other flavors are
maintained by specific contributors.</p>
